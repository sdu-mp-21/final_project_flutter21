As the name says, the app is about creating events meant only for SDU students
Functionality:
1.	Creating an event, that people can participate in-person.
2.	Viewing clubs list of SDU and their main informationCancel changes
The app will be usefull for clubs as Mountain Kings which are doing events actively.
Main purpose is to automate the process of ticket selling , so that they don't have to sit and sell them at the university.


Event publisher can manage participators list, set person limit, price (if participation is paid)
Event publisher should also give a description, accurate date and time and image (optional).
 
Future : 
In the future we wanted this app to be used by SDU clubs, so that club heads can manage club members and newcomers can join clubs through our app.
